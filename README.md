With a strong interest in combining financial insight with technical depth.

##  Current Projects

-  Exploring scalable **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** workflows using vector databases
-  Experimenting with **multi-agent systems** and **fine-tuning open-source LLMs**
-  Prototyping simple but powerful tools for **index research**, **backtesting**, and **reporting**

- Low-latency, high-signal strategies
- Research labs, hedge funds, and startups where theory meets execution
